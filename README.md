## **üìå The idea and purpose behind it‚Ä¶.**

This web app simulates a modern **selfie photobooth** setup, ideal for kiosk-like applications or creative demos. The interface showcases a booth, sample image strips, and a call-to-action ‚ÄúEnter‚Äù button to simulate the feeling of stepping in for a selfie session.

While this version focuses on visual design, it lays the foundation for integrating real photo-capturing capabilities using webcam APIs.

Although this version does not yet include JavaScript logic, the structure is designed for easy extension into:

- Countdown timers and animated flashes
- Canvas-based photo strip generation
- Download/share options

The entire UI is structured using CSS Flexbox and absolute positioning to align elements just like a real photobooth.
